=========Version 4==========
hello game devs

welcome to another episode in the marcakes series
where we try and add features to the karting microgame
today we are going to take the lobby from the
previous episode a step further and implement a track select screen
and restrict it so only the server can make the selection

if you have any suggestions, feel free to leave a comment down below
if you need help with anything please join the discord
details in the description

now let's begin

public class loadTrack : NetworkBehaviour
{
    [Scene]
    public string trackScene;

    public void loadTrackScene()
    {
        if (isServer)
        {
            Debug.Log("you loaded track " + trackScene);
            NetworkManager.singleton.ServerChangeScene(trackScene);
        }
        //Cmdloady();
    }

    // [Command(requiresAuthority = false)]
    // public void Cmdloady()
    // {
    //     NetworkManager.singleton.ServerChangeScene(trackScene);
    // }

}
=========Version 3==========
Implemented lobby system
Fixed some broken 

1. Look at example Mirror\Examples\Room
2. Check out README
3. Open all scenes and add them to build window in this order:
-	OfflineScene
-	RoomScene
-	OnlineScene
4. Show the NetworkRoomManagerEx (instead of NetworkManager)
5. Show the RoomPlayer prefab
	"NetworkRoomPlayerExt Score"
6. Show the GamePlayer
	"Player Score"
4. Build and run and demonstrate lobby
5. We won't do it exactly the same as this but this is really important to learn how it should be set up

1. Open Karting\Scenes\IntroMenu
2. Add to Build (first position) (remove everything else)
3. Create KartRoomPlayer	
	Add Component Network Identity
	Add Component Network Room Player
	Make it a prefab \Prefabs\KartRoomPlayer
	Delete from scene
4. New GameObject NetworkRoomManager
	Add Component NetworkRoomManager
		OfflineScene:                 \Karting\Scenes\IntroMenu
		OnlineScene:                  \Karting\Scenes\IntroMenu
		Transport:                    KCP Transport
		Player Prefab:                \Prefabs\KartClassic Variant
		Player Spawn Method:          Round Robin
		Room Player Prefab:           \Prefabs\KartRoomPlayer
		Room Scene:                   \Karting\Scenes\IntroMenu
		Gameplay Scene:               \Karting\Scenes\MainScene
		Registered Spawnable Prefabs: \Prefabs\projectile variant
	Add Component Network Manager HUD
	Add Component Kcp Transport	
6. Open \Karting\Scenes\MainScene
7. Add to Build (second position)
8. Delete NetworkManager GameObject
9. Create GameObject StartPos
	Add Component NetworkStartPosition
	Set position
	Duplicate x3
10. Open \Prefabs\KartClassic Variant
	Add Component Network Rigidbody
		Client Authority: True
		Sync Velocity:    True
		Sync Direction:   Client to Server
	Change Network Transform
		Sync Rotation:    True
		Sync Direction:   Client to Server
	
before we get into the tutorial
quick shout out to marcakes who joined the discord to ask about how to implement some extra features
such as having a menu and getting all the players to start at the same time
he did make some other requests, but for the purposes of this video we'll keep it really simple
and just implement the network lobby as easily as possible which will also act as the main menu

if you have questions about any of my videos or have requests, feel free to reach out in the comments or join the discord
please don't forget to drop a like if you find my video useful in way at all
